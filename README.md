# Coursera_Getting_And_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Files.
A full description of the dataset is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio with the assumption that the data files are stored in the working directory, with the folder name "UCI HAR Dataset".

The output of the 5th step is called tidy.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
